/**
 * Interface for a type-safe heterogeneous map.
 *
 * Objects of type HeteroMap cannot necessarily have keys added or removed, although mutable values can be
 * modified as usual. See MutableHeteroMap for a HeteroMap that must allow insertions and deletions.
 *
 * @tparam K the key type of the map.
 *
 * A Key for the map is parameterized by both the key type `K` and a corresponding value type `V`. The map
 * is indexed uniquely by a value of type `K`; no two entries in the map may have identical values of
 * Key::getId().
 *
 * All operations are sensitive to the value type of the key: a contains() call requesting an
 * integer labeled "value", for example, will report no such integer if instead there is a string labeled
 * "value". Therefore, it is impossible for an element insertion or retrieval operation to throw a
 * std::bad_cast or corrupt data. All methods that take a Key as an argument will use the exact type of the
 * key, without considering super- or subtypes; this is because allowing supertype keys (for reads) or subtype
 * keys (for writes) leads to self-inconsistent semantics on whether a particular typed key is or is
 * not in the map.
 *
 * All subclasses **must** guarantee, as a class invariant, that every value in the map is implicitly
 * nothrow-convertible to the type indicated by its key. For example, MutableHeteroMap ensures this by
 * appropriately templating all operations that create new key-value pairs.
 *
 * A HeteroMap may contain primitive types, strings, Storable, and standard smart pointers to
 * Storable as values. For safety reasons, it may not contain references, C-style pointers, or arrays to any
 * type.
