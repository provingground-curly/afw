        Parameters
        ----------
        field : str,Field
            The string name of the Field, or a fully-constructed Field object.
            If the latter, all other arguments besides doReplace are ignored.
        type\n : str,type
            The type of field to create.  Valid types are the keys of the
            afw.table.Field dictionary.
        doc : str
            Documentation for the field.
        unit : str
            Units for the field, or an empty string if unitless.
        size : int
            Size of the field; valid for string and array fields only.
        doReplace : bool
            If a field with this name already exists, replace it instead of
            raising pex.exceptions.InvalidParameterError.
        parse_strict : str
            One of 'raise' (default), 'warn', or 'strict', indicating how to
            handle unrecognized unit strings.  See also astropy.units.Unit.

        ----------

            A Field object that describes the new field to be added to the
